After a year of relentless research and development, the brand created its own unique formula for producing and manufacturing brown sugar. Unlike the conventional method of combining ready-made brown sugar syrup with pearls, Jenjudan caramelises its self-produced sugar in-house, transforming it from finely milled grains to thick, golden nectar. Pearls are then infused and slow cooked in the syrup, resulting in chewy, aromatic pearlfection. In order to maintain freshness and Jenjudan signature texture, the pearls are diligently cooked and glazed every two hours. Jenjudan is opening a second outlet at Orchard Gateway, #B2-10 from Saturday, 14 Sep!
